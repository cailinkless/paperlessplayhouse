      <p><strong><em>Take Me Home</em>
        <br>by Marisa Torelli-Pedevska</strong></p>
        <p>Stella is a seventeen-year-old in Cape Cod who has ordinary dreams: She wants to go to college far away from her family. But Stella’s family is anything but ordinary. Her two sisters, Denny and Julia, are both on the autism spectrum. When their mother finds out her cancer has returned, Stella’s dreams flash before her eyes. She has to do something she’s never done before: step up and be there for her family—especially her two sisters—who need her now more than ever. As Stella navigates this shifting reality, she also deals with her feelings for a new girl on her swim team who happens to be her biggest competition. Take Me Home is a coming-of-age story about a teenager who learns that she truly needs exactly what has been in front of her the whole time. Stella and her family force us to reconsider what it means to be “normal,” allowing us to explore the beautiful spectrum that is autism and showing us how siblings with special needs can shape a family.</p>
